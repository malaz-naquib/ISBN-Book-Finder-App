## Description:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

As usual, I layed out the HTML first to make sure I had all the content I wanted on the page (minus the objects we'll be fetching of course). After getting the HTML down and assigning classes, I did some light styling in CSS to get the general layout of my page down. Lastly, I began the process of properly fetching the objects we needed from our API from Open Library (https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) and properly placing them on our HTML elements. Finally, I went back to implement local storage, probably the most difficult aspect of the project, and VOILA! We have an ISBN finder app! 

## Lessons Learned:

With this project, I got to play around with local storage to ensure that your information stays between browser sessions. Honestly, this was pretty difficult as it was my first foray into implementing local storage in an app. Regardless, growth and learning were had through these difficulties! Overall, this was the neatest thing I learned to do while building this app. I'm stoked to be using local storage in my apps moving forward!
